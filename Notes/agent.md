Agentic AI coordinates multiple external APIs (weather, geo, policy checks) and resolves inconsistencies automatically, producing a complete claim context.

4. Initial Assessment & Triage

Agents combine rules, ML outputs, and extracted evidence to determine claim severity and routing, enabling smarter and faster triage than static rules alone.

Agents execute vision models, OEM pricing lookups, and severity logic in sequence, producing accurate, explainable repair estimates automatically.

7. Auto Settlement

Agentic AI applies policy rules, interprets complex clauses, and reconciles damage estimates to make safe, consistent settlement decisions with auditability.

Agents prepare structured summaries, manage human-in-loop workflows, and resume automation afterward, reducing adjuster workload dramatically.

9. Customer Communication

Agentic AI selects the best channel, generates personalized messages, and triggers follow-ups based on workflow state—far superior to static templates.
